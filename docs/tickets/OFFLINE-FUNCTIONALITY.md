**Ticket ID**: `OFFLINE-001`  
**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: PWA Enhancement  
**Assignee**: Development Team  
**Story Points**: 13  

## 📋 **User Story**

**As a** B2B marketplace user in Cameroon  
**I want** the Transac app to work offline with cached data  
**So that** I can continue browsing products, viewing my stores, and accessing critical information even when internet connectivity is poor or unavailable  

## 🎯 **Business Value & Importance**

### **Critical for Cameroon Market**
- **Poor Internet Infrastructure**: Many regions in Cameroon have unreliable internet connectivity
- **Mobile Data Costs**: High data costs make users selective about when to go online
- **Business Continuity**: Sellers need access to their store information even offline
- **User Experience**: Seamless experience increases user retention and engagement
- **Competitive Advantage**: Most local competitors don't offer offline functionality

### **Revenue Impact**
- **Increased Usage**: Users spend more time in app when offline-capable
- **Higher Conversion**: Buyers can browse and plan purchases offline
- **Seller Retention**: Sellers can manage inventory and view analytics offline
- **Market Expansion**: Reach users in areas with poor connectivity

## 🔧 **Technical Requirements**

### **Core Offline Features**

#### **1. Data Caching Strategy**
- **Products**: Cache product listings with images for offline browsing
- **Stores**: Cache store information and seller profiles
- **User Data**: Cache user preferences, favorites, and recent activity
- **Static Assets**: Cache all UI assets, icons, and critical images
- **API Responses**: Intelligent caching of API responses with TTL

#### **2. Offline-First Architecture**
- **Cache-First Strategy**: Always serve from cache when available
- **Background Sync**: Sync data when connection is restored
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle data conflicts when coming back online
- **Queue Management**: Queue user actions for later synchronization

#### **3. Storage Management**
- **IndexedDB**: Store structured data (products, stores, user data)
- **Cache API**: Store network responses and static assets
- **Storage Limits**: Implement intelligent cache eviction policies
- **Data Compression**: Optimize storage usage with compression

#### **4. Sync Mechanisms**
- **Incremental Sync**: Only sync changed data to minimize bandwidth
- **Priority Sync**: Sync critical data first (user stores, favorites)
- **Retry Logic**: Robust retry mechanisms for failed sync operations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent modifications gracefully

### **User Interface Features**

#### **1. Offline Indicators**
- **Connection Status**: Clear visual indicator of online/offline state
- **Data Freshness**: Show when data was last updated
- **Sync Progress**: Progress indicators during synchronization
- **Offline Mode Badge**: Visual cue when app is running offline

#### **2. Offline-Specific UI**
- **Cached Content Labels**: Mark content as "cached" or "offline"
- **Limited Actions**: Disable actions that require internet
- **Queue Status**: Show pending actions waiting for sync
- **Offline Onboarding**: Guide users on offline capabilities

#### **3. Smart Fallbacks**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduce functionality instead of breaking
- **Cached Images**: Show cached product images when available
- **Default Content**: Provide meaningful defaults when data unavailable
- **Error States**: Helpful error messages for offline limitations

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **1. Network Simulation Testing**

#### **Connection States**
```bash
# Test scenarios to simulate
1. Complete offline (no network)
2. Slow 2G connection (< 50kbps)
3. Intermittent connectivity (on/off every 30s)
4. High latency connection (> 3s response time)
5. Limited bandwidth (throttled to 100kbps)
```

#### **Browser DevTools Testing**
- Use Chrome DevTools → Network → Offline checkbox
- Throttle network to "Slow 3G" and "Fast 3G"
- Test service worker behavior in Application tab
- Monitor cache usage and storage limits

### **2. Functional Testing**

#### **Core User Journeys**
```gherkin
Scenario: Browse products while offline
  Given the user has previously visited the marketplace online
  When the user goes offline
  And opens the Transac app
  Then they should see cached product listings
  And be able to browse product details
  And view cached product images
  
Scenario: Seller dashboard offline access
  Given a seller has accessed their dashboard online
  When they go offline
  Then they should see their cached store information
  And view cached product inventory
  And see offline indicators clearly
  
Scenario: Data synchronization on reconnection
  Given the user made changes while offline
  When internet connection is restored
  Then pending changes should sync automatically
  And conflicts should be resolved appropriately
  And user should see sync completion status
```

#### **Edge Cases**
- App installation while offline
- Storage quota exceeded scenarios
- Corrupted cache recovery
- Partial sync failures
- Long-term offline usage (days/weeks)

### **3. Performance Testing**

#### **Metrics to Monitor**
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: > 90% for frequently accessed data
- **First Load Time**: < 2s for cached content
- **Storage Usage**: Efficient use of available storage
- **Sync Duration**: < 30s for typical sync operations
- **Battery Impact**: Minimal background sync battery usage

#### **Load Testing**
- Test with 1000+ cached products
- Simulate multiple users syncing simultaneously
- Test storage cleanup and eviction policies
- Verify performance with large image caches

### **4. Cross-Platform Testing**

#### **Browser Compatibility**
- Chrome/Chromium (primary target)
- Firefox (secondary target)
- Safari (mobile focus)
- Edge (Windows users)

#### **Device Testing**
- Android devices (various versions)
- iOS devices (iPhone/iPad)
- Low-end devices (limited storage/memory)
- Desktop browsers (Windows/Mac/Linux)

### **5. Real-World Testing**

#### **Field Testing in Cameroon**
- Test in areas with poor connectivity
- Validate with actual users and use cases
- Monitor real-world performance metrics
- Gather feedback on offline experience
