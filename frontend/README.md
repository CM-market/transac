This document outlines the functional and technical requirements for the **Transac** ecosystem, which includes the end‑user **Transac**, the **EventAdminApp**, the **EventRelay** servers, and the central **EventServer**.

---

## 1. Transac (PWA)

### General & Security Requirements

- **Key‑based Identity**  
  On first launch, the app generates a public/private key‑pair that serves as the user’s unique identity. There is no traditional registration (name, email, password).

- **Service Authorization**  
  To interact with the network (relays), a new user must first obtain a certificate.
  1. The app performs a Proof of Work (PoW) challenge.
  2. Upon successful completion, it submits the PoW solution to a relay’s registration endpoint.
  3. The relay issues a short‑lived client certificate.
  4. PoW difficulty is set high enough to deter DoS attacks.

### Functional Requirements

#### Event Creation

- Capture an image using the device camera.
- Reduce image size to support slow or unreliable networks.
- Annotate the image with labels defined by the admin.

#### Local‑First Data Management

- On first run, the app downloads and caches all available label configurations from a relay.
- It checks once daily for updated or new label configurations.

#### Label Annotation

Labels must support the following data types:

| Type                | Notes                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Date                | —                                        |
| Text                | Length constraints (e.g., 35 characters) |
| Number              | —                                        |
| Enumeration         | Dropdown list managed by admins          |
| Image / Short Video | —                                        |

#### Data Submission & Sharing

For each event, the app produces **two** distinct packages:

1. **Annotations‑only** (small) – reliable over any network.
2. **Image + Annotations** (large) – may need a stable connection.

- **Send**: An authenticated **Send** button packages the event and transmits it to a configured relay. The app stores the hash of the sent event for later verification.
- **Share**: If sending is not possible, a **Share** button packages the event as a single `.zip`. The file can be shared (WhatsApp, Bluetooth, etc.) so another Transac user can relay it.

#### Relay Management

- The app ships with an initial list of relays.
- It can query any relay for a list of other known, valid relays to improve network resilience.

---

## 2. EventAdminApp (PWA)

### General & Security Requirements

- **Key‑based Identity**  
  Generates a public/private key‑pair on first launch to sign administrative actions.

- **Admin Authorization**
  - Administrative functions are locked by default and are unlocked by importing an _admin certificate_.
  - A **SuperAdmin** (first admin) can authorize new admins:
    1. Prospective admin shows a QR code with their public key.
    2. SuperAdmin scans and signs it, producing an admin certificate.
    3. The new admin imports the certificate.

### Functional Requirements

#### Label Configuration

- Create, modify, and delete labels.
- Define data type for each label (text, number, date, etc.).
- Provide bilingual text (initially **French** and **English**).

#### Enumeration Management

- For _enumeration_ labels, add, edit, or remove selectable options.

#### Relay Management

- Form to add network addresses of new relays to the central server’s master list.

---

## 3. EventRelay

The EventRelay is a server‑side application acting as a gateway between Transac users and the EventServer.

### Functional Requirements

- **Message Forwarding** – Receive authenticated event packages from users and forward them to the EventServer.
- **Relay Discovery** – Expose an endpoint that returns a list of other known, valid relays.
- **Shareable Addresses** – Make relay addresses easily shareable (e.g., QR code or text string).

### Security & Registration Requirements

- **Authenticated Endpoint** – Only process messages cryptographically signed by a key‑pair holding a valid certificate.
- **PoW Registration Server**
  1. Receives PoW solution from new users.
  2. Validates the PoW.
  3. Issues a signed, short‑lived client certificate bound to the user’s public key.

---

## 4. EventServer

The EventServer is the central **stateless** backend. It interacts only with trusted EventRelays.

### Functional Requirements

#### Stateless Architecture

- Maintains no session state; each relay request is independently authenticated.

#### Event Processing

1. Expose a secure, private endpoint to receive event data from authenticated relays.
2. Validate the relay’s authenticity.
3. Store the event’s primary document (image/video + annotations) on S3‑compatible storage.

#### Blockchain Integration

- For every stored event, calculate a cryptographic hash.
- Push the hash to a designated blockchain to provide proof‑of‑existence and non‑repudiation.
- Transac users can later verify that their event hash exists on‑chain.

#### Relay Configuration & Provisioning

- Possess cloud credentials to **automatically launch new relay instances**.
- After launching a relay, sign and return an SSL certificate based on the relay’s **public IP address**.
- Provide a secure endpoint for EventAdminApp to manage the master list of approved relays.

## 5. Deployment and Verification (MinIO + Backend + Nginx)

This repository includes a working setup for MinIO-backed storage and an Nginx fronting the app. The backend receives events and uploads to S3-compatible storage (MinIO). Optionally, the frontend can talk directly to MinIO via Nginx.

### 5.1 Environment for infrastructure IP 51.20.117.244

- A ready-to-use env file is provided at `.env.aws`.
- Key values:
  - S3_ENDPOINT=http://51.20.117.244:9000
  - VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://51.20.117.244
  - MINIO credentials are default demo values; change for production.

Usage with docker compose:

- docker compose --env-file ./.env.aws up -d minio minio-init
- docker compose --env-file ./.env.aws up -d backend frontend

MinIO Console: http://51.20.117.244:9001

### 5.2 Verifying communication

1. Frontend to Backend

- Health: curl -k https://51.20.117.244/health
- API base: the frontend proxies /api/\* to the backend.

2. Backend to MinIO (server-side uploads)

- Backend reads S3\_\* env from .env.aws.
- On processing a signed event, the backend uploads JSON/ZIP to the bucket (eventserver-storage by default).
- Confirm in the MinIO Console that objects appear under the bucket when events are posted by a valid relay.

3. Frontend direct to MinIO (optional)

- Nginx proxies /minio/ to the MinIO API.
- Example: curl -k https://51.20.117.244/minio/minio/health/live should return 200.
- You can point any client-side S3 SDK to https://51.20.117.244/minio/ as the endpoint (path-style).

Notes

- SSL on Nginx expects certs in ./certs mounted into /etc/nginx/certs. For testing you can use self-signed certs.
- The backend’s CORS is permissive by default.
- Bucket initialization is done by the `minio-init` service.
